# Design Log

<!---

Preamble
---

The purpose of this design log is twofold:

1. To be a detailed log of the structure of my code, and the decisions I made while coding.
2. To be a demonstration of my problem-solving skills. To that end, I will capture each problem I encounter, and detail the steps I take to resolve it.
